## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned some new uses of CSS properties, such as opacity, to create a hover effect over the project image

### Continued development

I want to start learning more complex ways to apply CSS and create prettier styles, but I also need to keep learning and fixing the basics.
